        <h1>City  Slickers & Backcountry Experts</h1>
        <p>These little guys are often regarded by pedestrians and suburban homeowners as a pest, but we definitely do not see it that way. These critters are some of the most resourcesful, intelligent, and adaptable animals on the planet.</p>
        <p>This little guys are quite resilient in all types of enviornments. Being a <em>syanthropic</em> species means over time they have developed to benefit from human habitats and enviornments. But just like us city-dwellers who thrive in an urban enviornment, squirrels are masters of hitting the trails, grasslands and everything in between.</p>

        <div><h1>World Wanderers</h1>
            <p>Squirrels are part of the <em>Sciuridae</em> family - consisting of five different sub-families covering <strong>285</strong> species. These bad boys even have ancestors dating back to the <em>Chadronian</em> period, 40-35 million years ago.</p>
            <p>Originally hailing from America, Eurasia, and Africa - Squirrel species can now be found on all continents except Antartica. There is debate over whether Australia is considered to have squirrels. Indrocution of American Grey and the Northern Palm squirrel have occurred but are now considered extinct in Australia with the exception of in zoos. </p></div>

        <div><h1>Crunchy Boys</h1>
            <p>Most squirrells arre considered <em>scatter-hoarders</em>. The process of burying most of their food in caches is known as <em>"chucking"</em>. Research has shown that squirrels are capable of retirveing up to 95% of their chucked food caches. Many consider their style as orginazational chucking - meaning they cache similar food types in one area away from other caches containing different foods.</p>
            <p>Squirrels eat a variety of foods varying with each season. Nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fungi, greens, and fruits. Most stick to primarily an herbivore diet, but some have been known to eat smaller animals, snakes, eggs and insects.</p>

    <div><h1>Random Facts</h1>
        <p>Their teeth never stop growing and can average <strong>6 inches</strong> of groth a year!</p>
        <p>The word 'squirrel' comes from the Greek words "skia" for shadow, and the word "oura" for tail. Together they form the basis of the the naming of their genus Sciurus.</p>
        <p>Most squirrels are solitary, but some adults will nest with eachother during the cold winter months. A group of squirrels is called a "scurry" or "dray".</p>
        <p>Squirrels will often pretend to bury food, as other squirrels have the habit of spying on others and attempting to steal a easy meal from someone else.</p></div>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This site is a project created by me, Blake Agrade for Seattle Central College's IT161 class.</p><p> I'm definitely a fan of squirrels and have a wild squirrel friend named Squerbs. She's been around my apartment for the past few years, and I've gotten to befriend her and meet some of her offspring.</p>
